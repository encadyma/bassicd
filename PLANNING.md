# Planning (in progress)

This should work as a crystal ball. You put in what you want, wave your hands around the ball, and out spits a bunch of future pathways you can take. The program optimizes, but you choose the way.

In its end form, you should be able to choose:
- What classes you want to take, interested in learning, etc.
- What majors you are interested in, what majors you want to declare, etc.
- What skill sets you want to have by the end of each term
